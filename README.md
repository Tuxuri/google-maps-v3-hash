google-maps-v3-hash
===================

Keeps the state of a google map instance in the URL hash as a permalink. Only good for one instance of google maps per page obviously.

To install, simply load the js file after loading the google maps v3 library

then initialize it like so:

`new google.maps.UrlHash(map);`

Blah blah blah this is in an early stage of development and be careful using it yadda yadda.
